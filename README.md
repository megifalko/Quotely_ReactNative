Quotely is a mobile app which allows users to create an account and after logging in <br>
user can add and browse his inspirational quotes. Quotes are stored in the Firebase <br>
database. Currently I'm working on adding a feature which allows to search for other <br>
users and read their saved quotes or add certain quote into one's own collection.
